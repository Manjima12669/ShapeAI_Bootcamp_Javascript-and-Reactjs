# [SHAPEAI Javascript and Reactjs BOOTCAMP](https://shapeai-reactjs-bootcamp-manjimabanerjee.netlify.app/)
<p>Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

<p>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li><a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Javascript</a>
<li><a href="https://html.com/">HTML</a>
<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a>
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
</p>
<p>I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well.
